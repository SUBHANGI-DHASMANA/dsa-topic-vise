# [Move zeroes to end](https://bit.ly/41nQRnY)

### Problem statement
Given an array 'A' of 'N' non-negative integers and has been asked to move all the O's in it to the end of an array and non-zero elements to the start of the array maintaining the order.
Your task is to modify the array accordingly and return the required modified array.

```
Example:
Input: 'N' = 5,
'A' = [1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0]
Moved all the 's to the end of an array and the rest of the elements retain the order at the start.
```

## Detailed explanation (Input/output format, Notes, Images}
### Input Format:
```
The first line of each test case will contain the integer 'N' the number of elements in the array 'A' and the next line will contain the 'N' spaced integers in the array elements.
```
### Output Format:
```
Output for each test case will be printed on a separate line.
```
### Note:
```
You are not required to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.
```
### Constraints:
```
1 ≤ A.Length ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9

Time limit: 1 sec
```
