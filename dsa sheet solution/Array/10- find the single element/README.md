# [Find The Single Element](https://bit.ly/3Vj03Z1)

### Problem statement
You are given a sorted array 'Arr' of positive integers of size 'N', which contains each number exactly twice except for one number, which occurs exactly once. You have to find the number that occurs exactly once.

```
Example:
For 'N' = 7 and 'Arr' = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4}.
1, 3, and 4 occur exactly twice. 2 occurs exactly once. 
Hence the answer is 2.
```

### Constraints:
```
1 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= Arr[i] <= 10^9
'N' is always odd.
Time Limit: 1 sec
```
