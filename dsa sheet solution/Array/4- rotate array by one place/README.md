# [Left Rotate an Array by One](https://bit.ly/3KV9QRk)

### Problem statement
Given an array "ARR' containing 'N' elements, rotate this array Left by once means to shift all elements by one place to the left and move the first element to the last position in the array.

```
Example:
Input: 'N' = 5, 'ARR' = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
We moved the 2nd element to the 1st position and 3rd element to the 2nd position and 4th element to the 3rd position and 5th element to the 4th position and move 0th element to the 5th position.
```

## Detailed explanation (Input/output format, Notes, Images}
### Input Format:
```
The first line will contain a single integer 'N', the size of the array 'ARR'
The second line will contain 'N' integers representing the array elements.
```
### Output Format:
```
Returned the array as described above.
```
### Note:
```
You don't need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
```
### Constraints:
```
1 <= N <= 10^5.
1 <= ARR[i] <= 10^g
Time Limit: 1 sec
```
