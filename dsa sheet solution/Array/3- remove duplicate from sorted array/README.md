# [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://bit.ly/3KV9QRk)

### Problem statement
You are given a sorted integer array' ARR' of size 'N'. You need to remove the duplicates from the array such that each element appears only once. Return the length of this new array.
### Note:
```
Do not allocate extra space for another array. 
You need to do this by modifying the given input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
```

## Detailed explanation (Input/output format, Notes, Images}
### Input Format:
```
The first line contains an integer 'N' denoting the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains 'N' space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.
```
### Output Format:
```
Return the length of the modified array.
```
### Note:
```
You don't need to print anything, it has already been taken care of.
Just Implement the given function.
```
### Constraints:
```
1 <= N <= 10^5
-10^9 <= ARR[i] <=10^9
Where 'ARR[i]' is the value of elements of the array.
Time limit: 1 sec
```
